Version 0.1.4:
Changes:
-Added an entire new location, the Gym! There you can increase your physique and athletics. But you'll have to pay an upfront cost every day you want to enter. There is also a separate place to learn about the ways of the fighters: Discipline and Humility.

Small Changes:
-Added the three transformations to the "Transformations" area in Extra Stats.

Bug fixes:
-Fixed the nameless Stand sometimes not being properly referenced in texts.
-Some more granma fixes.
-No more error messages when using Killer's Sheer Heart Attack against 3 or more people.
-High submissiveness Stand chance boost for three-Stand skills now requires the same amount of submissiveness needed to be considered "meek". It was 100 more before. Skills affected by this were: Fighting; Dancing; Skulduggery.
-Timed events should no longer take half their expected time to end.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.3e - New Game Version 0.2.16.3:

Bug Fix Verion 2:
-No more error messages when listening while bartending.
-No more error messages in Attitudes menu while being a Vampire or a Hamon user.
-Fixed a whole bunch of problems involving using Heaven's D. in a beast.
-Added the option to use unlimited Stand abilities to the cheats menu.
-We added a full changelog (as you might have noticed). From now on, all the changes from the very first version of DoBL will be forever documented in here.

Bug Fix Verion:
-Garden now works again
-Hermit is now able to open any lock, as advertised.
-No more error messages when trying to pick a lock.
-No more error messages during history lessons.
-No more error messages when seducing someone.
-Forest will no longer softlock randomly.
-Stand ability counter in tentacle encounters is where it was supposed to be.

Changes:
-Added a new Stand and the School skills category (that uses the former secret Stand):
	P. Haze - Fighting middle submissiveness. A powerful Stand that infects people with a deadly virus (watch out, you're not immune to viruses by any means!). Expect accidental kills in Araki Mode.
	Heaven's D. - English School skill. Does not fight well, but can be used in combat to *rewrite* your opponent's lives (former password Stand).

-Now Vampires will immediately regain control over their bodies in case of orgasm or overwhelming pain.

-Completely reworked the action of "Stinging into someone's blood vessel":
	Old: Could only be used if the PC is overwhelmed by pain. Caused low damage (based on PC's Physique and Fighting stats), restored a moderate amount of health (aka reducing pain) and reduced Vampire's thirst by a moderate amount.
	New: Renamed to "Feed on blood". Can be used anytime, including in consensual encounters. Causes a low, fixed amount of damage (way less than before, doesn't increase anger but does reduce trust and submissiveness), restores a slight high amount of health and reduces Vampire's thirst by a moderate amount.

-Completely reworked the Vampire exclusive "Bite" action:
	Old: Could only be used if the PC is overwhelmed by pain. Caused medium damage, restored a slight high amount of health and reduced Vampire's thirst by a high amount.
	New: Renamed to "Nibble and sip". Can be used anytime, including in consensual encounters. Causes a low, fixed amount of damage (doesn't increase anger but does reduce trust and submissiveness), restores a slight high amount of health and reduces Vampire's thirst by a moderate amount.

-Reworked G. Experience's Heal ability's formula. Now the amount of health restored per Science+Tending skill is a direct function instead of a logarithmic function.

Minor changes:
-Reworked how Stand stats are shown (in Traits menu). Now a Nameless Stand can have its stats showed (but no useful info will be given). And different Stands will show themselves in different colors.
-Added the following skills to the following Stands:
	Star Finger (Star, cost 1) deals less damage than the usual attack but from farther away.
	Red Bind (Magician, cost 4) traps one target for 10 seconds (one turn) and deals damage.
	Needle Skewer (Chariot, cost 2) deals massive damage, and potentially multihits (increased chance without armor).
	Emerald Splash (Hierophant, cost 1) deals slightly more damage than the usual attack, from farther away.
	Bomb Transmutation (Killer, cost 4) deals a massive amount of damage to 1 target.
-Added Heaven's D. and P. Haze to the cheat menu.
-Reworked some damage calculation. Some Stands might have become a little stronger and others a little weaker.
-Some overall improvements to the code.
-Added command for Heaven's D.: "Can't touch my genitals". The NPC will be unable to touch any of the PC's genitals until the end of the combat. If an NPC is already touching one of the PC's genitals, it will let go; and further touches will be impeded.

Bug Fixes:
-Showing Stand abilities will now properly show the cost of usage for G. Experience's abilities.
-Hermit will now be unable to fight in wrestles (like should have been).
-A small typo that led to less probability of getting school skills than intended was corrected.
-Several unintended results and errors in several different places were corrected.

Known bugs:
-The odds of getting Heaven's D. are slightly higher than it should be. This is in preparation for new content.
-A wrestling is kinda broken. And there are stuff missing. This has been in my highest priority to rework, but the code is so massive that it would take way too long to rewrite everything. This is probably gonna take it's own entire patch to fix.


Patch Notes:
*As of 0.2.16.2, daily willpower decay was reduced from 1.5% to 1%. The modded decay of 0.5% (for non-Joestars) stays unchanged.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.3d:

Emergency mid-month update, to kill some game-breaking bugs and other annoying things.

Changes:
-Removed Heaven's Door from the cheat list.
-Added Harvest to the cheat list.
-Reworked the Stand cheats options for updating reasons.
-Renamed some Stands for consistency reasons. Hopefully, for the last time.
-Updated the overnight Stand-get that was rusting for some reason.

Bug Fixes:
-Hamon should not break the game anymore.
-The bunker fight with Jotaro should not result in an unintended ending when he uses his Stand.
-Some incorrect text for some Stands' abilities.
-Some incorrect text when Stands interact with beasts.
-Finishing masturbation and consensual encounters won't fill you with a sudden desire to kill someone anymore.
-Remembered to update the version number this time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.3c:

Minor Changes:
The mod's discovery feats are now hidden.
The "Hamon master" feat was changed: now it is not hidden anymore and only shows itself after "Hamon user" is obtained.

Bug Fixes:
Undefined variable for the Bunker now works normally.
Trying to swim will no longer break your browser.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.3b - New Game Version 0.2.13.4:

Changes:
Added Stands for the Tending skill:
G. Experience - A decently powerful Stand that can give life to an inanimate object. Can also heal the user if needed.
Harvester - A colony Stand, not usable in battle but can make some chores easier. After each day they'll have found something for you, if you were sleeping.

Also added a little secret Stand, only for the most curious ones. In a future update, it will be a skill-based Stand like the others.

Added a Special tier 3 Feat for G. Experience. You'll need a lot of MUDAs.

Added a little event when trying to escape the livestock farm if the perfect conditions meet. (This will be expanded in the future)

Now you can decide to evolve your Stand, or not, by choosing the skills you want it to consider when getting a name (or choose none to keep the Stand nameless).

You should now (hopefully) be able to export your vanilla DoL save file and your older versions of DoBL to the current version of DoBL from now on. Any problem with save file stuff, contact Rukarin.

Minor Changes:
Added and adjusted some jobs and fames for Killer Q.'s Bites the Dust.
Extensive code and QoL improvements, and some minor bugs fixed.
You will no longer be unable to kill students/teenagers if you *really* want to kill people.
Renamed various Stand abilities.
(Finally) implemented Stands for vore encounters.

Balancing:
Sucking someone's blood no longer increases fighting skill.
Reduced pleasure given when extracting blood from someone's pussy with your hands by 25%.
Increased the amount of pain inflicted when biting someone's breasts while being a vampire by 50% (to better match cat/wolf transformations').
Biting on someone's penis while you're a vampire no longer increases crime.
Magician's Fire Hurricane will now hit all opponents in a given combat.
Virginities will no longer be reverted when using Bites the Dust.
Spice G.'s Wannabe will no longer be affected by "softening"'s ability to reduce damage. (Previously did 50% of the damage when you were softened)
Spice G.'s Softening ability will now preserve your penile/vaginal virginity (if active) even after penetration.
Decreased daily willpower decay (when not a Joestar): from 1.5% per day to 0.5% per day.
Increased willpower gain when "overwhelmed by pain" by 40% and "overwhelmed by arousal" by 100%.
Increased willpower gain when meditating by 100%.

Bug fixes:
Stand abilities should now work properly on beasts.
Fixed some weird effects happening when Stands encounter tentacles.
Submissiveness should now properly be considered when getting a Stand name.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.1 - New Game Version 0.2.11.2:

Changes:
-Added Araki mode! Now you can kill people! But that comes at the cost of increasingly trauma gain and very high crime increase.

-Added the mod's own Feats! 19 of them are visible, but 3 of them are unobtainable for now.

-Now skills can have multiple Stands tied to them. The determining factor being submissiveness. When there are three Stands in one skill, high submissivenes means Meek or Submissive; low submissiveness means Bratty or Defiant; medium submissiveness means neither. When there are two Stands in one skill, high submissiveness means anything above the default and low submissiveness means anything below the default; as such, the game might not indicate whether the submissiveness is higher or lower than the threshold. The value of submissiveness is not a definitive sentence, but rather an increased likelyhood.

-The existing Stands were divided in their respective skills:
	Star P. - (fighting) Low submissiveness (below default).
	Magicians R. - (dancing) Low submissiveness (bratty or defiant).
	Hierophant G. - (swimming) High submissiveness (above default).
	Hermit P. - (skulduggery) Low submissiveness (bratty or defiant).

-Added the following Stands:
	Crazy D. - Fighting, high submissiveness (above default). Fixes clothes when they break.
	Chilli P. - Dancing, medium submissiveness (below Meek, above Bratty). Weak, powers up and becomes very strong.
	Echoes 3 - Dancing, high submissiveness (Meek or Submissive). Weak, but indefinitely locks up 1 opponent.
	Silver C. - Swimming, low submissiveness (below default). Can power up and attack multiple times per turn.
	Killer Q. - Skulduggery, medium submissiveness (below Meek, above Bratty). Can turn back time. Stops crime increase when killing someone.
	Cinderella - Skulduggery, high submissiveness (Meek or Submissive). Cannot battle. Changes the appearence of the player. Resets fame.
	Spice G. - Lewd skills, low submissiveness (below default). Powerful, can reduce damage taken and given.
	Bastet - Lewd skills, high submissiveness (above default). Cannot fight, but can disable multiple opponents in battle.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.0 - Game Version 0.2.3.2:

Degrees of Bizarre Lewdity created!

Main changes:
-Pain reduction by time was reduced by a third of what it used to be.

-Day/night cycle changed from 15h(6-21 or 6AM-9PM)/9h(21-6 or 21PM-6AM) to 13h(7-20 or 7AM-8PM)/11(20-7 or 8PM-7AM).

-You can now train at the waterfall to gain willpower.

-Added the Fighting skill: The more you fight (defiant act), the more damage you will cause thanks to combat experience.

-Added the Elk Wrestling Bunker: a place to fight and get money from fighting.

-Added the Joestar Background: Willpower will increase instead of decrease daily (meet someone at the waterfall to further increase daily willpower gain).

-You can now acquire three new transformations:
	Hamon user/master - Training consistently at the waterfall will make you worthy of the Sun technique. With it you can use a powered up left and right punch that also heals the you, a powered up kick that heals you, and an incredibly powerful attack meant to be used by both hands at the same time. Pain will relief up to 2.25x faster.

	Vampire - If you can find the mask and be desperate enough to use it, you will be bestower god-like powers. You will heal very fast (3x faster), all your defiant actions will cause 3x the normal damage, and you will be much more successful when using seduction. But vampires cannot outstand sunlight, therefore it's difficult for them to survive during the day.

	Stand user - With enough willpower and skill, you will be able to summon the entity to help you in battle. The current Stands are:
	-Star P(latinum).: Fighting skill Stand. Very powerful in combat; can stop time for a couple turns.
	-Hierophant G(reen).: Swimming skill Stand. Standard power; can create a web of strings to damage the opponent passively .
	-Magician's R(ed).: Dancing skill Stand. Standard power; can use a very powerful attack every now and then.
	-Hermit P(urple).: Skulduggery skill Stand. Low power; makes crime not increase.
