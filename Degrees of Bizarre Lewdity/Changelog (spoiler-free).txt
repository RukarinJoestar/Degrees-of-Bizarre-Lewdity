Version 0.1.4:
Changes:
-Added an entire new location, the Gym! There you can increase your physique and athletics. But you'll have to pay an upfront cost every day you want to enter. There is also a separate place to learn about the ways of the fighters: Discipline and Humility.

Small Changes:
-Added the three transformations to the "Transformations" area in Extra Stats.

Bug fixes:
-Fixed the nameless spirit sometimes not being properly referenced in texts.
-Some more granma fixes.
-No more error messages when using a certain spirit's persistant ability against 3 or more people.
-High submissiveness spirit chance boost for three-spirit skills now requires the same amount of submissiveness needed to be considered "meek". It was 100 more before.
-Timed events should no longer take half their expected time to end.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.3e - New Game Version 0.2.16.3:

Bug Fix Verion 2:
-No more error messages when listening while bartending.
-No more error messages in Attitudes menu while being an ungodly creature or a Sun fighter.
-Fixed a whole bunch of problems involving using a certain spirit's ability in a beast.
-Added the option to use unlimited spirit abilities to the cheats menu.
-We added a full changelog (as you might have noticed). From now on, all the changes from the very first version of DoBL will be forever documented in here.


Bug Fix Verion:
-Garden now works again
-A certain spirit is now able to open any lock, as advertised.
-No more error messages when trying to pick a lock.
-No more error messages during history lessons.
-No more error messages when seducing someone.
-Forest will no longer softlock randomly.

Changes:
-Added a new spirit and the School skills category (that uses the former secret spirit):
	Fighting middle submissiveness. A powerful entity that infects people with a deadly virus (watch out, you're not immune to viruses by any means!). Expect accidental kills in Araki Mode.
	English School skill. Does not fight well, but can be used in combat to *rewrite* your opponent's lives (formerly password exclusive).

-Now a certain type of otherwordly creature will immediately regain control over their bodies in case of orgasm or overwhelming pain.

-Completely reworked two actions exclusive to the aforementioned creature: They got renamed and now are usable in consensual encounters (whereas previously it wasn't possible). Causes low damage and heals a little bit.

-Reworked a certain spirit's Heal ability's formula. Now it's a direct function instead of a logarithmic function.

Minor changes:
-Reworked several text information, to make it more appealing to the eyes.
-Added 5 new abilities to existing spirits:
	A meme attack that deals lower damage than the usual attack but from farther away.
	Traps one target for 10 seconds (one turn). Target gets burned.
	Barrage attack, but with potential multihits.
	A mourning attack that deals slightly more damage than the usual attack, from farther away.
	Deals *explosive* amounts of damage to 1 target.
-Added the two first spirits to the cheat menu.
-Reworked some damage calculation. Some spirits might have become a little stronger and others a little weaker.
-Some overall improvements to the code.
-Added a new command for the writing spirit.

Bug Fixes:
-One of the spirits that wasn't showing its abilities now does so.
-"The weakest" spirit will now be unable to fight in wrestles (like should have been).
-A small typo that led to less probability of getting school skills than intended was corrected.
-Several unintended results and errors in several different places were corrected.

Known bugs:
-The odds of getting the school spirit are slightly higher than it should be. This is in preparation for new content.
-A special type of combat is kinda broken. And there are stuff missing. This has been in my highest priority to rework, but the code is so massive that it would take way too long to rewrite everything. This is probably gonna take it's own entire patch to fix.

Patch Notes:
*As of 0.2.16.2, daily willpower decay was reduced from 1.5% to 1%. The modded decay of 0.5% (for non-Joestars) stays unchanged.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.3d:

Emergency mid-month update, to kill some game-breaking bugs and other annoying things.

Changes:
-Removed a spirit from the cheat list.
-Added a spirit to the cheat list.
-Reworked the spirit's cheats options for updating reasons.
-Renamed some spirits for consistency reasons. Hopefully, for the last time.
-Updated the overnight spirit getting sequence that was rusting for some reason.

Bug Fixes:
-Sun fighter should not break the game anymore.
-A certain hidden post-fight passage should not result in an unintended ending now.
-Some incorrect text for some spirits' abilities.
-Some incorrect text when spirits interact with beasts.
-Finishing masturbation and consensual encounters won't fill you with a sudden desire to kill someone anymore (Araki mode only).
-Remembered to update the version number this time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.3c:

0.1.3c:
Minor Changes:
The mod's discovery feats are now hidden.
A certain series of feats was changed: The first one is hidden and always shows itself. The second one is not hidden and only shows itself after the first is obtained.

Bug Fixes:
Undefined variable for the hidden location now works normally.
Trying to swim will no longer break your browser.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.3b - New Game Version 0.2.13.4

Changes:
Added spirits for the Tending skill:
Low Submissiveness - A decently powerful spirit that can give life to an inanimate object. Can also heal the user if needed.
High Submissiveness - Not usable in battle but can make some chores easier. After each day it'll have found something for you, if you were sleeping.

Also added a little secret spirit, only for the most curious ones. In a future update, it will be skill-based like the others.

Added a Special tier 3 Feat for one of the above spirits.

Added a little event when trying to escape the livestock farm if the perfect conditions meet.

Now you can decide to evolve your spirit, or not, by choosing the skills you want it to consider when getting a name (or choose none to keep the spirit nameless).

You should now (hopefully) be able to export your vanilla DoL save file and your older versions of DoBL to the current version of DoBL from now on. Any problem with save file stuff, contact Rukarin.

Minor Changes:
Added and adjusted some jobs and fames for a certain spirit's reversion ability.
Extensive code and QoL improvements, and some minor bugs fixed.
You will no longer be unable to kill students/teenagers if you *really* want to kill people.
Renamed various spirit's abilities.
(Finally) implemented spirits for vore encounters.

Balancing:
Doing ungodly things to someone no longer increases fighting skill.
Reduced pleasure given when doing ungodly things to someone by 25%.
Increased the amount of pain inflicted when biting someone's breasts while being an ungodly creature by 50% (to better match cat/wolf transformations').
Biting on someone's penis while you're an ungodly creature no longer increases crime.
Made so that a certain spirit's hot ability will now hit all opponents in a given combat.
Virginities will no longer be reverted when using a certain spirit's reversion ability.
A certain spirit's barrage of punches will no longer be affected by its other ability to reduce damage.
The aforementioned ability will now preserve your penile/vaginal virginity (if active) even after penetration.
Decreased daily willpower decay (when not a Joestar): from 1.5% per day to 0.5% per day.
Increased willpower gain when "overwhelmed by pain" by 40% and "overwhelmed by arousal" by 100%.
Increased willpower gain when meditating by 100%.

Bug fixes:
Spirit's abilities should now work properly on beasts.
Fixed some weird effects happening when spirits encounter tentacles.
Submissiveness should now properly be considered when getting the name of a spirit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.0 - Game Version 0.2.3.2:

Degrees of Bizarre Lewdity created!

Main changes:
-Pain reduction by time was reduced by a third of what it used to be.

-Day/night cycle changed from 15h(6-21 or 6AM-9PM)/9h(21-6 or 21PM-6AM) to 13h(7-20 or 7AM-8PM)/11(20-7 or 8PM-7AM).

-You can now train at the waterfall to gain willpower.

-Added the Fighting skill: The more you fight (defiant act), the more damage you will cause thanks to combat experience.

-Added a new, hidden location to get money in Elk Street.

-Added the Joestar Background: Willpower will increase instead of decrease daily (meet someone at the waterfall to further increase daily willpower gain).

-You can now acquire three new transformations:
	Transformation 1 - Fighter with the power of the Sun. With it you can use a powered up left and right punch that also heals the you, a powered up kick that heals you, and an incredibly powerful attack meant to be used by both hands at the same time. Pain will relief up to 2.25x faster.

	Transformation 2 - Ungodly creature. You will heal very fast (3x faster), all your defiant actions will cause 3x the normal damage, and you will be much more successful when using seduction. But vampires cannot outstand sunlight, therefore it's difficult for them to survive during the day.

	Transformation 3 - You will be able to summon a spirit to help you in battle with enough skill. The current spirits go as it follows:
	-Fighting skill: Very powerful in combat; can stop time for a couple turns.
	-Swimming skill: Standard power; can create a web of strings to damage the opponent passively .
	-Dancing skill: Standard power; can use a very powerful attack every now and then.
	-Skulduggery skill: Low power; makes crime not increase.
